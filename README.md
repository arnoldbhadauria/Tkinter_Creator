# Cappuccino
This is really cool (atleast for me). Cappuccino helps you to initialize some tkinter boilerplate code via a GUI window(written in tkinter). It is also an old project so ignore the inefficient code and lack of common sense.
I m hoping to convert this into a fully functional GUI creator for tkinter.
